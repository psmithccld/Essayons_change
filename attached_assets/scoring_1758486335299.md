Survey responses are turned into scores that provide leaders with a clear picture of change health.

Readiness Score

Derived from Readiness Survey items (awareness, urgency, readiness, trust).

Formula: average Likert (1–5) → normalize to 0–100.

Interpretation:

80–100 = High readiness, momentum is strong.

50–79 = Moderate readiness, communicate more.

<50 = Low readiness, pause and address barriers.

Understanding Score

From Understanding Survey (clarity, role, purpose, resources).

Formula: average Likert → 0–100.

Interpretation:

80–100 = People “get it.”

<50 = Major confusion; stop and clarify.

Reaction Score

From Pulse Survey (sentiment + support + confidence).

Formula: map Excited=5 → Resistant=1, average with Likert, → 0–100.

Interpretation:

Rising score = adoption growing.

Falling score = resistance building; respond quickly.

Success Score

From Post-Mortem (integration, benefits, reinforcement, 1–10 rating).

Formula: average → normalized to 0–100.

Interpretation:

80+ = Sustainable change achieved.

<60 = Risk of regression.

Composite Change Health Score

Formula: 25% each of Readiness, Understanding, Reaction, Success.

Use as an executive dashboard metric.

Leaders should investigate which component is dragging the score down.

Leadership Toolbox Reminder:
Numbers tell a story, but not the full story. Always pair metrics with conversations, reflection questions, and feedback loops.
