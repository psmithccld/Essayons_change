4. Stakeholder Reports

Cross-Initiative Stakeholder Load Report – individuals tagged to multiple initiatives → potential overload or influence bottlenecks.

5. Readiness & Surveys (the big one)

This is where the Essayons Change framework really differentiates you. Think survey results → metrics → trends.

Readiness Reports

Phase Readiness Score Report – aggregate readiness % by initiative and phase.

Survey Response Report – detailed question/response breakdown with filters (initiative, phase, stakeholder type, date).

Sentiment Trend Report – pulse scores (excitement → resistance) over time.

Understanding Gaps Report – % of respondents who don’t understand purpose/role/resources.

Post-Mortem Success Report – overall success scores across initiatives, with lessons-learned themes.

Response Rate Report – completion %, distribution across stakeholder groups.

Cross-Cutting Reports

Change Health Dashboard – weighted composite (Readiness, Understanding, Sentiment, Success) by initiative.

Org Readiness Heatmap – initiatives scored against each other to show where adoption risk is highest.

Stakeholder Sentiment Report – filter survey results by stakeholder type or role.

🧭 Guidance

Start with filterable tabular reports for each object type (users, tasks, RAID, stakeholders, surveys).

Add summary dashboards for leaders (e.g., Org Readiness Heatmap, Change Health Dashboard).

Tie reports back to phases — every report should be able to show “Where in the fishbone are we seeing issues?”
