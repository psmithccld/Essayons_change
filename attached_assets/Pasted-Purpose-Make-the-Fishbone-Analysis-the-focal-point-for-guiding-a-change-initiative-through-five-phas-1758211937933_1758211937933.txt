Purpose
Make the Fishbone Analysis the focal point for guiding a change initiative through five phases. It should help users see where they are, understand what to do next (organizational + individual actions), and create the right work items (tasks, milestones, RAID entries, communications).

Overall vibe
Clear, calm, encouraging. Minimal UI chrome. The content is the star. Use concise labels, short tips, and obvious calls to action.

Top bar

Show the initiative name and the current phase.

Provide two primary actions:

Advance to next phase (with an optional confirmation step).

Plan next phase (lets users prepare work items for upcoming phase without advancing).

Fishbone layout

Horizontal spine from left to right with five labeled phase nodes:

Identify Need to Change

Identify Stakeholders

Develop the Change

Implement the Change

Reinforce the Change

The current phase is visually highlighted. Completed phases look “checked.” Upcoming phases look neutral.

Hover tips (tooltips) — show BOTH organizational actions and individual adoption cues
When the user hovers any phase, show a small card with two short lists:

Identify Need to Change

Organizational: clarify business problem; define success metrics; align leadership narrative.

Individual: explain the “why”; reduce uncertainty; invite early questions.

Identify Stakeholders

Organizational: map influence/interest; assign sponsors/champions; choose comms channels.

Individual: clarify roles and impact; open feedback loops; surface resistance early.

Develop the Change

Organizational: design process/tech changes; build training & support; define readiness gates.

Individual: show “what changes for me”; provide how-to guides; offer practice spaces.

Implement the Change

Organizational: publish schedule; monitor adoption; remove blockers fast.

Individual: encourage first wins; give just-in-time help; share exemplars.

Reinforce the Change

Organizational: measure outcomes vs. targets; update SOPs; recognize contributors.

Individual: celebrate progress; reflect on lessons; embed new habits.

From any phase, the user can create these items (without leaving the screen):

Task (owner, due date, phase tag)

Milestone (name, date, success criteria)

RAID entry (risk/assumption/issue/dependency, severity, owner)

Communication (audience, channel, message draft, planned send date)

Behavior

Creating an item should feel lightweight (small modal or side panel).

Default the new item’s phase to the phase the user is viewing.

If the user chooses Plan next phase, default new items to the next phase (but do not advance the initiative).

After Advance to next phase, prompt: “Do you want to create or review items for the new phase now?”

Microcopy

Empty state: “Start here—hover a phase to see tips. Create a task or note for what needs to happen next.”

Success: “Saved. You can find this under [Tasks/RAID/Comms] and on this phase.”

Advance confirm: “Advance to [Next Phase]? You can still return to earlier data.”

Progress cues

Each phase node shows small badges: number of open tasks, open RAID, scheduled comms.

A subtle “readiness/sentiment” indicator can appear under the current phase if available.

Accessibility & simplicity

Short labels. Clear focus states. Keyboard-friendly navigation.

Keep text readable and avoid dense paragraphs in tooltips.

Done when

I can hover any phase and instantly see concise org + individual tips.

I can create a task, milestone, RAID, or communication from the current phase or for the next phase without leaving the screen.

I can advance the initiative to the next phase or plan that phase’s work in advance.

Current, completed, and upcoming phases are visually distinct and easy to understand at a glance.
