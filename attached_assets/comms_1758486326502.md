Communication is the leader’s most powerful tool. In Essayons Change, communication is split into Strategy (what, who, when, why) and Execution (how).

Strategy

Phase Alignment

Need to Change → explain urgency and vision.

Stakeholders → engage influencers and listen.

Develop → clarify roles, resources, and expectations.

Implement → reinforce, celebrate short-term wins, address blockers.

Reinforce → embed lessons, recognize success.

Stakeholder Identification

Who needs what message?

Who resists, who champions?

Resistance Handling

Listen → acknowledge → respond with clarity.

Use GPT Coach for suggested counter-messaging.
