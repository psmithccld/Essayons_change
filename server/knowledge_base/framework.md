Essayons = "Let us try!"
This is the spirit of the Essayons Change Framework: a practical, action-oriented approach to leading and living through organizational change.

The framework is built around five phases, each with organizational actions (leaders, systems, structures) and individual adoption actions (employees, teams, personal readiness). It combines classic models (Lewin, Kotter, ADKAR, McKinsey) with military principles (Mission Command, commander's intent, shared understanding).

1. Identify Need to Change

Organizational Actions

Clarify the problem and urgency.

Define the vision of success.

Communicate the "why" with honesty.

Individual Actions

Ask questions; seek clarity.

Reflect on how the change may affect your role.

2. Identify Stakeholders

Organizational Actions

Map influence and interest.

Appoint sponsors and champions.

Build two-way communication loops.

Individual Actions

Clarify your role in the change.

Provide honest feedback early.

Identify peers you can influence or support.

3. Develop the Change

Organizational Actions

Design the solution and roadmap.

Build training and support plans.

Set readiness checkpoints.

Individual Actions

Learn what will change in your daily work.

Participate in training or pilots.

Practice new ways of working.

4. Implement the Change

Organizational Actions

Launch with clarity and discipline.

Monitor adoption and address blockers quickly.

Share progress and celebrate wins.

Individual Actions

Apply new processes in daily work.

Share successes and challenges with honesty.

Support others by modeling adoption.

5. Reinforce the Change

Leadership Reminder: Change is not linear. Be adaptable. Use commander's intent to keep everyone aligned: communicate clearly, empower teams, and trust your people to make the right decisions.
